# Coffe shop finder
This is my first project made with Flask in Python, and also the first one to use HTML and a database. It creates a website that shows you a list of coffee shops, it's characteristics and a picture of the place. 
It also allows you to add or remove more coffee shops. 
The challenge was taken from the 100 Days of Code bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ and solved as part of the course.
